        <p><h3>Hi! My name is Faith Aston. Makeup is a very strong passion of mine. In 2021, I had a serius medical crash from my normal but hard lifestyle. I have a VP shunt to drain spinal fluid that is not able to drain on its own, due to various medical conditions that I struggle with. That shunt was severely overdraining causing me to have very low spinal pressure in my head and spinal column. The problem was fixed and now I am getting back to my normal! Makeup was something I could do when I was not able to be upright for a long period of time. I enjoy giving people makeovers and trying out new trends and makeup hacks! I love doing both colorful and neutral color and shade looks. If you would enjoy getting your makeup and or hair done, just send me a pic of the look ahead of time to let me know what look you want, it gives me time to perfect it!
