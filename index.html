        <p><h3>Hi! My name is Faith Aston. Makeup is one of my very strong passions that I enjoy doing. In 2021, I had a serius medical crash from my normal lifestyle. I have a VP shunt to drain spinal fluid that is not able to drain on its own, due to various medical conditions that I struggle with. That shunt was severely overdraining causing me to have very low spinal pressure in my head and spinal column. That problem was fixed and now I am getting back to normal! Makeup was something I could do when not able to be upright for a long period of time. I enjoy giving people makeovers and trying new trends of makeup hacks! I love doing both colorful and neutral colors and shades. If you would enjoy getting your makeup and or hair done, just send me a pic of the look ahead of time to let me know what look you want and give me time to perfect it!
